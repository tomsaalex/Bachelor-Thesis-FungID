# Bachelor's Thesis - FungID

## The application
A client-server application developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis composed of three components:
 - [The mobile client](https://github.com/tomsaalex/FungID_FrontEnd)  
    Built as an Android app in Kotlin, it has the primary goal of acting as a portable foraging app.
 - [The server](https://github.com/tomsaalex/FungID_BackEnd)  
    Built in Spring Boot, it serves as the place where most of the business logic of the application happens, from account management, to authorization and data storage, as well as access to the third component, the AI model.
 - [The AI model](https://github.com/tomsaalex/FungID_AI_Model)  
    Built in Python using PyTorch, it uses the best of the models described in the thesis' paper in order to determine the species of a mushroom present in an image.

## Also attached
In addition to the application, I have also attached my written bachelor's thesis on the subject, as well as the slides used for the presentation before the comission.
